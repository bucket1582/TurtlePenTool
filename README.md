A pen tool implemented using the turtle module. It is meaningless to use this tool unless you are a turtle module nerd.

Features
---
1. Press "p" for pen tool mode.
2. Press "m" for move mode.
3. Press "r" to refresh the paintings \
   You have to refresh the paintings to look at the finished work. There will be some disconnected parts if not.

If you click a point connected to another point, you will see some small dots.
Those dots are handlers for the curve. You can move the handlers to update the curve.
