This is a pen tool implemented by using the turtle module. It is meaningless to use this tool unless you are a turtle module nerd.

Features

1. Press "p" for pen tool mode.
2. Press "m" for move mode.
3. Press "r" to refresh the paintings
a. You need to refresh the paintings sometimes since there would be some disconnected parts in the curve.

If you click a point that is connected to another point, you will see some small dots.
Those dots are handlers for the curve. You can move the handlers to update the curve.
